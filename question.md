# Welcome to Day 1 of the Bash Scripting Challenge!

Today marks the beginning of your journey into the world of bash scripting! We’ll be covering the essentials to set you on the right path. Let’s get started!

## Task 1: Comments
In bash scripts, comments serve as helpful annotations or can be used to temporarily disable code lines. **Your task:** Create a bash script that includes comments to explain the purpose of each section.

## Task 2: Echo
The `echo` command allows you to display messages in the terminal. **Your task:** Write a bash script that employs `echo` to print a message of your choice.

## Task 3: Variables
Variables are vital for storing data in bash, and you can reference them by name. **Your task:** Develop a bash script that declares several variables and assigns values to them.

## Task 4: Using Variables
Now that you’ve declared variables, let’s put them to work! **Your task:** Create a bash script that takes two numerical variables as input and prints their sum.

## Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
Bash includes a variety of built-in variables that contain useful information. **Your task:** Construct a bash script that uses at least three built-in variables to display relevant information.

## Task 6: Wildcards
Wildcards are special characters that allow for pattern matching when handling files. **Your task:** Create a bash script that utilizes wildcards to list all files with a specific extension in a directory.

## Submission Instructions:
Compile all tasks into a single bash script. Be sure to include comments throughout to clarify each part of the script, ensuring it’s well-documented and easy to follow.

To submit your work, create a GitHub repository and commit your script there.
